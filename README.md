This is a calculator for a binary expression tree that supports two-operant addition and multiplication of integers from [0, ..., 9].

bet_read() reads one binary expression, which must be represented in Polish notation (or prefix notation), from input.
- Supported operators are binary + and * (all operators support exactly two operants).
- Supported values are integers between 0 and 9 (both inclusive). 

For example:
Input: (+ 3 ( * ( + 5 9 ) 2 ) )\
Output: "The BET evaluates to 31."!
